# Description
This small mobile application demonstrates the use of variables, expressions, conditionals and other features in a simple Quiz app. It is also a huge step forward towards building a full android application, which I will in the next weeks. 

# Dev Environment
In order to run this type of application you need Android Studio.
The right plugings, android version and graddles will be dowloaded as soon as Android Studio detects what the app uses.

You also need an emulator, you can choose any device you'd like within android studio. This was built with a screen similar to the PIXEL 3 in mind.

# Run
Go to the following path QuizApp/app/src/main/java/com/quizapp/MainActivity.kt Using the instructions from above, make sure everything has been imported and dowloaded correctly and press the play button located on the upper right corner of Android Studio.

This will open the virtual device and emulate the app running. 
-Enter your name.
-Start the Quiz.
-Finish game and see how you did.
